# NBA Shot Charts
Python/Pandas/Matplotlib/JSON

Project to create shot charts for all NBA players within all NBA seasons in the NBA API.
Using JSON requests from the NBA API to build a Pandas data frame with all our relevant data. 
Create our court and hexbin gradients based on Pandas data with Matplotlib.

*Iteration 1*
Solely based on field goal attempts for the player compared to the league.

*Iteration 2*
Based on Grantland-style shot charts.
Accounts for both field goal attempts and made field goals from the player vs. league average.
Larger hexagon = more attempts. Red hexagon = more makes.
